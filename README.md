# Russian Squat Program Generator

The **Russian Squat Program** _(also called Old School Squat Routine)_ is a
classic high-frequency, high-volume squat cycle (usually 6 weeks) designed to
rapidly increase your back squat strength by squatting three days per week with
planned progression in weight and volume.

_(This program can also be used for deadlift)_

## Core idea

- You squat, for example, Mon / Wed / Fri
- You start with high volume at moderate intensity
- Over the weeks, volume gradually drops while intensity rises
- It peaks with heavy doubles/singles and a new max attempt

## Typical structure

Percentages are based on your current 1RM (one rep max).

### Week 1

- Day 1: 6×2 @ 80%
- Day 2: 6×3 @ 80%
- Day 3: 6×2 @ 80%

### Week 2

- Day 1: 6×4 @ 80%
- Day 2: 6×2 @ 80%
- Day 3: 6×5 @ 80%

### Week 3

- Day 1: 6×2 @ 80%
- Day 2: 6×6 @ 80%
- Day 3: 6×2 @ 80%

### Week 4

### Week 5

### Week 6

There are multiple variants floating around, but this is the general pattern people mean by **Russian Squat Program**.
